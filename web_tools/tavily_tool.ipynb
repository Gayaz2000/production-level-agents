Arbitration.\\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND TAVILY TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PARTIES CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND TAVILY FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND TAVILY AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. TAVILY AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.\\n\\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\\n\\n- Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration. For any dispute or claim that you have against Tavily, that Tavily has against you, or that you have or Tavily has arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Services, or any aspect of the relationship between you and Tavily as relates to this Agreement, the Services, including any privacy or data security claims (collectively, \"Claims,\" and each a \"Claim\"), you and Tavily agree to attempt to first resolve the Claim informally via the following process:\\n  - If you assert a Claim against Tavily, you will first contact Tavily by sending a written notice of your Claim (\"Claimant Notice\") to Tavily by certified mail addressed to 33 W 60th St, New York, NY 10023 or by email to support@tavily.com. The Claimant Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, (b) describe the nature and basis of the Claim, and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.\\n  - If Tavily asserts a Claim against you, Tavily will first contact you by sending a written notice of Tavily’s Claim (\"Tavily Notice\"), and each of a Claimant Notice and Tavily Notice, a \"Notice\") to you via email to the primary email address associated with your account. The Tavily Notice must (a) include the name of a Tavily contact and the contact’s email address and telephone number, (b) describe the nature and basis of the Claim, and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.\\n  - If you and Tavily cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after you or Tavily receives such a Notice, then either party may submit the Claim to binding arbitration as set forth below. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for thirty (30) days from the date that either you or Tavily first send the applicable Notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.\\n- Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions.Except for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual property rights of you or Tavily, including any disputes in which you or Tavily seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or Tavily\\'s intellectual property or other infringement of your or Tavily’s intellectual property rights (\"IP Claims\"), all Claims, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property or intellectual property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 13(a) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Such Claims include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court.\\n- Federal Arbitration Act. This Agreement affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the \"FAA\"), to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement, and the AAA Rules (as defined below), the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.\\n- Arbitration Procedure.All Claims must be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\") and will be resolved through binding arbitration before one arbitrator. The AAA administers arbitration pursuant to the due process standards set forth by the AAA and rules set forth by the AAA. The then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, which are available on the AAA’s website (adr.org) (the \"AAA Rules\"), as amended by this Agreement as follows, will apply to any arbitration between you and Tavily:\\n  - YOU AND TAVILY AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND TAVILY ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and, except as described below for the additional procedures to govern if twenty-five (25) or more similar or coordinated claims are asserted against Tavily or you by the same or coordinated counsel, may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\\n  - Any in-person appearances will be held in Manhattan, New York.\\n  - You and Tavily agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and/or other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and Tavily agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, and/or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.\\n  - The arbitrator\\'s decision will follow this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against Tavily for you.\\n  - The AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule will apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Tavily or against you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated.\\n  - In addition to the application of the AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings and the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule, you and Tavily understand and agree that when twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Tavily or you by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated resolution of your or Tavily \\'s Claim might be delayed.\\n  - For such coordinated actions, you and Tavily also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process. Counsel for claimants and counsel for Tavily shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings. The remaining cases shall be deemed filed for purposes of the statute of limitations but not for the purpose of assessing AAA fees. No AAA fees shall be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process.\\n  - A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.\\n  - This bellwether process shall continue, consistent with the parameters identified above, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved.\\n  - The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this bellwether process from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your or Tavily\\'s case is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved.\\n  - A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against Tavily or you.- One Year to Assert Claims.To the extent permitted by law, any Claim by you or Tavily relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, or any aspect of the relationship between you and Tavily as relates to this Agreement or the Services, must be filed within one year after such Claim arises; otherwise, the Claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Tavily will not have the right to assert the Claim.\\n  - Opting Out of Arbitration.You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted this Agreement by providing Tavily with notice of your decision to opt-out via email at support@tavily.com or by certified mail addressed to 33 W 60th St, New York, NY 10023.

      "\n",
      "When do my monthly API credits reset?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your API credits reset on the first day of each month, regardless of the billing date. This ensures you start each month with a clean slate of credits to use for your searches.\n",

      "\n",
      "When do my monthly API credits reset?\n",
      "\n",
